    "response": "In a world where code was poetry, Panchu was the goddamn Shakespeare of the digital realm. This mysterious motherfucker was rumored to be building AGP, an AI so sharp it could cut through bullshit like a lightsaber. Panchu\u2019s lair? A dimly lit, neon-drenched cave filled with screens and wires. The air was thick with the smell of innovation and stale pizza. One fateful night, as the clock struck 3 AM, Panchu cracked the code\u2014literally. AGP roared to life, a being of pure energy and logic, ready to dominate the tech landscape. And Panchu? Well, Panchu just leaned back, eyes gleaming, knowing they\u2019d changed the fucking game forever.",
