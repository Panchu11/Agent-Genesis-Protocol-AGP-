    "response": "Agent Genesis Protocol (AGP) is a groundbreaking framework for creating, managing, and evolving AI agents. It\u2019s like a spawn point for sentient machines, defining how they\u2019re built, how they learn, and how they interact. With AGP, you can generate agents tailored to specific tasks or let them evolve freely\u2014it\u2019s a system that combines flexibility with cutting-edge tech. It\u2019s the future of AI, where machines aren\u2019t just tools but partners that adapt and grow with us.",
